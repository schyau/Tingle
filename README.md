Tingle
======
For singles who want to mingle.

If you've tried online dating, then you understand the onerous task of profile maintenance.  If you've gone on a few dates, chances are you've met someone who didn't own up to their online persona.  Online dating has come a long way in its goal to streamline romantic encounters, but it's fraught with its own challenges.

The problem is miscommunication.  Dating profiles read more like sales pitches than self descriptions.  Voice intonations, posture, gesticulations, eye contact, and other non verbal subtleties are lost in online messages.  How can we expect to find a suitor with all this misinformation?

We need to circumvent the noise caused by profiles and messaging and go directly from signing up to meeting up.

Introducing Tingle.  We here at Tingle like to think differently.  We believe your time is valuable and should be spent engaging in real life encounters.  Skip the profile maintenance, the misleading conversations, and the laborious plans to meet.  Streamline romantic encounters effortlessly.  Sign up now to get your Tingle on!

Tingle was a project submitted on November 8th for BbMobile's 2nd Quarterly Hackathon.  We won 3rd place!  There are no plans to continue this project.
