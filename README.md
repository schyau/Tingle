Tingle
======
For singles who want to mingle.

Tingle is a native Android dating app that allows users to meet each other based on their locations.  It's easy to set up.  Simply fill in your preferences, then we'll generate a set of potential suitors filtered based on your preferences.  You have the options of either upvoting or downvoting each person from this set, and these choices are stored in our servers.  If two people who have previously upvoted each other are within the general vicinity, both of you will feel a Tingle!  

We believe first impressions mean a lot.  Which is why we believe first impressions shouldn't be made behind a computer.  With Tingle, you will be notified immediately if a potential suitor is nearby.  So if you feel a tingle, be prepared to mingle.

Tingle was a project submitted on November 8th for BbMobile's 2nd Quarterly Hackathon.  We won 3rd place!  There are no plans to continue this project.

UPDATE 3/6/2014

It is with great sadness that I must inform you the tragic deleting of our backend code.  As a result, this app is no longer functional.
