Tingle
======
For singles who want to mingle.

Sign up.  Create profile.  Engage in conversation.  Meet.  That's the service you get from most online dating websites.  If you've tried online dating, then you know profile maintenance is a huge time sink.  If you've gone on a few dates, chances are you've met someone who was a lot different from their online persona.  And what about the people you've prematurely written-off?  What if they could've been a great match for you?  You'd never know.

Research has shown that body language plays a significant role in communication.  Which means you miss out on a huge part of communication in online dating.  Your first impression of a potential suitor is based on the words you read while sitting behind your computer screen-- words that have been carefully chosen, modified, and remodified. 

What if we could skip the noise from profiles and conversations and go directly from signing up to meeting up?

Introducing Tingle.  We here at Tingle like to think differently.  We here at Tingle believe your time is valuable.  Call us old fashioned, but we also believe first impressions should be made in real life.  Skip the profile maintenance, misleading conversations, and laborious planning.  We've got that taken care of for you.  Sign up now to get your Tingle on!


Tingle was a project submitted on November 8th for BbMobile's 2nd Quarterly Hackathon.  We got 3rd place!  And a $50 gift card for Amazon.com, ($30 more than last time #movingup).  There are no plans to continue this project.
